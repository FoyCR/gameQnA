# GameQnA

This a early prototype, It emulates a board game of questions and answers, where a board is generated in which each square has a type assigned: art, science, sports, etc. And each player has a category: preschool, elementary, college, depending on their age. 
When a new turn is generated, a dice roll is simulated for the player in turn: depending on the type of square and the player's category, a question will be generated with four options of which only one is correct. If the player selects the correct answer, he/she advances the number of squares indicated in the question if he/she does not stay in the square in which he/she fell.
To generate the questions we are using AI (**chatGPT**).
